I did these projects in C++ to learn more about programming. 

Here I practiced notions such as: Procedural programming (all basic elements), Object Oriented Programming (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism), Fundamentals of STL and so on. 

Some of these projects are done in QT - a very good and nice GUI Framework.

I hope you enjoy. Keep learning!
